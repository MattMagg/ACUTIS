"""High level pseudocode for hardware abstractions."""

# Pseudocode Outline:
# - AirCoupledTransducer represents a transmitter or receiver unit
# - Initialization stores an identifier
# - transmit_pulse() would trigger the hardware to emit an ultrasonic burst
# - receive_echo() would capture a returned signal amplitude
