"""Pseudocode for a simple command line interface.

The CLI concept is intended to demonstrate the pipeline in a textual way:

1. parse a list of collar positions from command line arguments
2. run a simulated data acquisition over those positions
3. feed the readings into the processing routine
4. print or store the resulting information

No actual argument parsing or scanning logic is implemented yet. These notes are
purely descriptive.
