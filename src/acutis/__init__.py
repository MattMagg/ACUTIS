"""Package placeholder with pseudocode references.

This package currently contains only descriptive modules. No runnable
implementations are provided, but the following conceptual pieces are outlined:

* hardware abstractions
* collar movement control
* data acquisition workflow
* signal processing routines
* simulation utilities
* a high level scanner and command line interface

These names are left here as documentation only and are not imported.
