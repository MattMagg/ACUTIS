"""Pseudocode describing a high level scanning workflow.

The scanner is imagined as an orchestrator that ties data acquisition together
with signal processing. A future implementation might:

1. accept a list of collar positions to inspect
2. call the data acquisition routines for each position
3. send the collected readings through the processing pipeline
4. store or display the resulting metrics

These steps are noted here solely as a descriptive outline and not as runnable
code.
