"""Pseudocode for coordinating data acquisition."""

# Pseudocode Outline:
# - DataAcquisition brings together a transmitter, receiver and collar
# - scan_step(position):
#     * move collar to position
#     * fire transmitter and read receiver
#     * return captured amplitude
# - scan_profile(positions):
#     * iterate through a list of positions and build a profile of readings
