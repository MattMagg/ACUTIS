"""Pseudocode for signal processing routines.

This file merely lists ideas for how captured readings might be analysed:

* filtering and normalisation steps to clean the data
* extraction of features that highlight defects
* computation of metrics such as attenuation along the pole

The real `process_signal` algorithm will be designed once sample data becomes
available. Until then the details remain as descriptive notes rather than
executable code.
