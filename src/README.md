The `src` directory houses descriptive pseudocode modules under the `acutis`
package. These files outline planned components such as hardware control, collar
movement, data acquisition, processing, and basic simulation. A scanner module
demonstrates how these pieces might be orchestrated. They contain no working
code and exist solely as placeholders until a real implementation is
developed.
