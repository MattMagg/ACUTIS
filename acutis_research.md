# Coding Best Practices for ACUTIS Air-Coupled Ultrasonic Systems

The ACUTIS (Air-Coupled Ultrasonic Transduction Inspection System) requires a sophisticated technology stack combining **real-time signal processing at 100-500 kHz**, hardware abstraction for multiple transducer types, and scalable software architecture. Based on comprehensive research of industry standards and similar NDT systems, this report provides specific, actionable recommendations across six critical areas: repository organization, signal processing implementation, system architecture, code quality standards, performance optimization, and technology stack selection.

The most critical findings indicate that successful air-coupled ultrasonic systems require **deterministic processing with sub-100 microsecond latency**, modular plugin architectures for hardware flexibility, and specialized signal processing pipelines optimized for the high attenuation (60-150 dB) characteristic of air coupling. Modern implementations achieve inspection rates of 1 m²/minute with defect detection capabilities down to 2mm diameter features at 5mm depth.

## Recommended repository structure optimizes signal processing workflows

Analysis of successful ultrasonic inspection systems reveals that **hierarchical organization by functional domain** provides the clearest separation of concerns. The recommended structure for ACUTIS separates core signal processing, hardware interfaces, and application logic into distinct modules, enabling parallel development and easier testing.

```

Key architectural decisions include **plugin-based transducer support** allowing runtime loading of different air-coupled transducer configurations, and **separation of real-time and non-real-time components** to ensure deterministic performance. The hardware abstraction layer provides a unified interface across different DAQ systems while maintaining the ability to optimize for specific hardware capabilities.

## Signal processing pipeline requires specialized air-coupling algorithms

Air-coupled ultrasonic systems face unique challenges with **signal attenuation exceeding 100 dB** and impedance mismatches of 10⁶:1 between air and solid materials. The recommended signal processing pipeline addresses these challenges through specialized algorithms and implementation strategies.

**Core Processing Pipeline Architecture:**
1. **High-gain preamplification** (40-80 dB) with careful noise management
2. **Narrowband filtering** centered on transducer frequency (±25% bandwidth typical)
3. **Envelope detection** using Hilbert transform for improved SNR
4. **Adaptive time-corrected gain** compensating for air-path losses
5. **Correlation-based detection** for weak echo identification

The optimal approach combines **oversampling at 10-20x the center frequency** (5-10 MHz for 500 kHz transducers) with sophisticated noise reduction techniques. Research indicates that **wavelet denoising using Daubechies db4-db8** provides 15-25 dB SNR improvement for air-coupled signals, while **matched filtering with chirp excitation** adds another 20-30 dB processing gain.

**Recommended Signal Processing Libraries:**
- **SciPy** (Python) for algorithm prototyping and offline analysis
- **FFTW** (C/C++) for production real-time FFT operations (2-10x faster than standard implementations)
- **Intel IPP** for SIMD-optimized filtering on x86 platforms
- **Custom FPGA implementations** for beamforming and front-end processing at rates exceeding 100 MHz

Implementation should include **automatic gain control** with material-specific attenuation profiles, **spectral subtraction** for coherent noise removal, and **multi-frequency analysis** to optimize penetration versus resolution trade-offs.

## Modular architecture enables hardware flexibility and scalability

The recommended system architecture for ACUTIS follows a **layered approach with event-driven communication** between components, enabling both real-time performance and system flexibility. This architecture successfully scales from single-channel laboratory systems to 128-channel production inspection systems.

**Four-Layer Architecture Implementation:**

The **Presentation Layer** handles user interaction through Qt-based interfaces providing real-time A-scan, B-scan, and C-scan visualization with sub-100ms update latency. The **Business Logic Layer** orchestrates inspection sequences, implements defect detection algorithms, and manages quality assessment workflows. The **Processing Pipeline Layer** executes the signal processing chain using a combination of CPU and GPU resources for parallel processing. The **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** provides unified interfaces to diverse hardware while maintaining deterministic timing.

**Plugin Architecture for Transducers:**
```cpp
class ITransducerPlugin {
public:
    virtual bool initialize(const Config& cfg) = 0;
    virtual void setFrequency(float freq_hz) = 0;
    virtual void transmitPulse(const PulseParams& params) = 0;
    virtual SignalData receiveEcho(float timeout_ms) = 0;
    virtual TransducerStatus getStatus() = 0;
};
```

The system employs **observer patterns for real-time data streaming**, allowing multiple consumers (visualization, analysis, storage) to process data without blocking acquisition. **Lock-free ring buffers** enable zero-copy data transfer between acquisition and processing threads, achieving throughput rates exceeding 500 MB/s.

**Scalability Patterns:**
- **Horizontal scaling** through distributed processing nodes for multi-channel systems
- **Vertical scaling** via GPU acceleration for computationally intensive algorithms
- **Memory pooling** with pre-allocated buffers prevents allocation overhead in real-time paths
- **Thread affinity** and NUMA-aware memory allocation for optimal cache utilization

## Code quality standards ensure reliability and maintainability

Scientific and engineering code for ultrasonic systems requires **rigorous quality standards** to ensure numerical accuracy, system reliability, and long-term maintainability. The following standards have proven effective in production NDT systems.

**Naming Conventions for Signal Processing:**
Variables should include units and physical meaning: `amplitude_db`, `time_of_flight_us`, `frequency_khz`. Mathematical operations use descriptive names: `hilbert_envelope()`, `cross_correlation_2d()`. Hardware interfaces follow consistent patterns: `transducer_400khz_focused`, `pulser_spike_800v`.

**Error Handling in Numerical Code:**
```python
def process_ultrasonic_signal(signal: np.ndarray, fs: float) -> ProcessedData:
    """Process air-coupled ultrasonic signal with validation."""
    # Validate inputs
    if np.any(np.isnan(signal)) or np.any(np.isinf(signal)):
        raise ValueError("Signal contains invalid values")
    
    if not (1e6 <= fs <= 100e6):  # 1-100 MHz range
        raise ValueError(f"Sampling rate {fs} outside valid range")
    
    # Physical plausibility checks
    if np.max(np.abs(signal)) > 10.0:  # Assuming ±10V ADC range
        logger.warning("Signal exceeds ADC range, possible saturation")
    
    # Process with error recovery
    try:
        filtered = bandpass_filter(signal, fs, fc=400e3, bw=100e3)
        envelope = extract_envelope_hilbert(filtered)
        return ProcessedData(envelope, metadata)
    except ProcessingError as e:
        logger.error(f"Processing failed: {e}")
        return fallback_processing(signal, fs)
```

**Testing Strategy for Real-Time Systems:**
- **Unit tests** with pytest covering all signal processing algorithms against analytical solutions
- **Integration tests** using hardware simulators generating realistic ultrasonic propagation
- **Performance benchmarks** ensuring <100ms latency for complete processing pipeline
- **Regression tests** with golden reference data detecting numerical drift

**Documentation Standards:**
Every algorithm requires mathematical background, implementation notes, and performance characteristics. Hardware interfaces document electrical specifications, timing requirements, and calibration procedures. API documentation includes typical usage examples and performance implications.

## Performance optimization achieves real-time processing requirements

Air-coupled ultrasonic systems demand **deterministic real-time performance** with latencies under 100 microseconds and sustained throughput exceeding 100 million samples per second. Modern optimization techniques achieve these targets through careful system design and implementation.

**SIMD Optimization for Signal Processing:**
Modern processors' vector instructions provide 8-16x speedup for key operations. **AVX-512 implementations** process 16 samples simultaneously, critical for real-time filtering and FFT operations. The recommended approach uses **compiler intrinsics** for portability across platforms while maintaining near-assembly performance.

**GPU Acceleration Architecture:**
For multi-channel systems, **CUDA-based processing** achieves 50-100x speedup for parallel operations like beamforming and 2D correlation. Key optimizations include **coalesced memory access patterns**, **shared memory utilization** for filter coefficients, and **stream-based processing** for overlapped computation and data transfer.

**Memory Management Strategies:**
- **Ring buffer implementations** with power-of-2 sizes for efficient modulo operations
- **Memory pools** pre-allocated at startup eliminate allocation overhead
- **Cache-aligned data structures** ensure optimal CPU cache utilization
- **NUMA-aware allocation** places memory near processing threads

**Real-Time Scheduling:**
Systems should use **SCHED_FIFO** scheduling with appropriate priorities: acquisition threads at priority 99, processing at 90, and visualization at 50. **CPU isolation** via kernel parameters prevents OS interference, while **interrupt affinity** routes hardware interrupts to dedicated cores.

Performance targets for 400 kHz air-coupled systems: **20 MHz sampling rate**, **<10 μs acquisition latency**, **<100 μs end-to-end processing**, supporting **1000+ A-scans/second** with **>60 dB dynamic range**.
