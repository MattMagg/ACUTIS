# Documentation

This folder contains notes and supplementary material for the ACUTIS concept.
The file `architecture.md` gives a brief overview of the current software
layout. A high-level, incremental roadmap is available in `development_plan.md`.
Additional design sketches and references can be added here as the project
evolves.
