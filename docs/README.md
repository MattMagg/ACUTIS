# Documentation

This folder contains notes and supplementary material for the ACUTIS concept.
The file `architecture.md` gives a brief overview of the envisioned system
layout. A high-level, incremental roadmap is available in `development_plan.md`.
Short descriptions of proposed modules are kept under `notes/`. Additional
design sketches and references can be added here as the project evolves.
