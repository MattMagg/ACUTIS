# Signal Processing

Once raw signals are collected, they will be analysed to detect signs of internal decay or voids in a pole. The processing approach will likely involve:

- Filtering to remove noise and normalise readings.
- Feature extraction that highlights significant changes in the signal.
- Metrics that indicate attenuation or other markers of damage.

The precise algorithms remain to be developed. These notes simply capture the intent of analysing each scan to assess pole health.
