# Command Line Tool

A simple command line interface will eventually provide access to scanning commands and utilities. Potential features include:

- Accepting a list of scan positions or a range with step size.
- Initiating a scan using the collar and acquisition modules.
- Displaying or saving processed results for later review.

For now this is only a conceptual placeholder describing how an operator might interact with ACUTIS from a terminal.
