# Simulation Ideas

Before hardware prototypes exist, it may be helpful to model expected signals. A simple simulation could generate echoes with different amplitudes and delays. Such a tool could:

- Provide synthetic test data for processing algorithms.
- Explore how defects might appear in a scan profile.
- Allow incremental development while waiting for real sensors.

This document records the concept without prescribing any specific implementation.
