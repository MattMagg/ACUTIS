# Collar Control

The collar is envisioned as a climbing mechanism that travels vertically along a utility pole. It will position the ultrasonic hardware at various heights. Key considerations include:

- Reliable movement up and down the pole without damaging the surface.
- Awareness of current height so scans can be associated with specific locations.
- Safety checks to prevent the collar from slipping or applying too much pressure.

These points provide a direction for future engineering work, not a finalized design.
