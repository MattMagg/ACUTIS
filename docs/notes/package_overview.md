# ACUTIS Notes Overview

This folder collects short descriptions of planned ACUTIS components. The project is still at an early research stage, so the notes do not contain any code. They simply outline the roles that each part of the system will play once development begins.

Current topics include:
- The main transducer pair (`transducer.md`)
- Hardware abstractions (`hardware.md`)
- Collar control (`collar.md`)
- Data acquisition (`data_acquisition.md`)
- Signal processing (`processing.md`)
- Scanner workflow (`scanner.md`)
- Simulation ideas (`simulation.md`)
- Internal agent plan (`../internal_agent_plan.md`)
