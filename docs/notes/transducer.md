# Transducer Design

This note captures initial ideas for the main air-coupled transducer pair. The goal is a non-contact system capable of transmitting ultrasound through a wooden pole.

- **Transmitter**: Generates a short burst of ultrasound at a frequency tuned for wood penetration (e.g. tens of kilohertz). Power output must be sufficient to reach the receiver on the opposite side.
- **Receiver**: Detects the waveform after it passes through the pole. Integrated amplification and filtering help recover weak signals.
- **Mounting**: Both units mount on the collar with adjustable brackets so alignment can be maintained during a scan.
- **Protection**: Weather-resistant housings shield the transducers from dust and moisture while allowing sound to travel freely.

These points describe the intended capabilities rather than final specifications. Detailed measurements and component choices will be refined as prototypes are tested.
