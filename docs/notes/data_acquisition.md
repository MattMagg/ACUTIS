# Data Acquisition

The data acquisition process will coordinate collar movement with the ultrasonic transducers. A typical scan will involve stopping at predefined heights, sending a pulse, and recording the resulting echo. Important goals include:

- Simple routines for moving the collar to each height in a scan profile.
- Collection of raw amplitudes and timing information from the sensors.
- Storage of readings for later processing and analysis.

Implementation details will depend on the final hardware, so this note serves as a placeholder until prototypes are built.
