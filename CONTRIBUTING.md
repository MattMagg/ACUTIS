# Contributing to ACUTIS

This project welcomes pull requests. Use the following workflow when synchronizing your work:

1. Fetch the latest changes and rebase (or merge) the target branch:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main   # or `git merge origin/main`
   ```

2. If conflicts occur, resolve them manually and check the result:

   ```bash
   # edit files to fix conflicts
   git status  # verify all conflicts are resolved
   ```

3. Commit the resolved files and push your branch.
