# ACUTIS

ACUTIS is an early stage concept currently represented by a collection of project documents and high level pseudocode modules. The specific implementation language may change as the system grows. This repository lays the groundwork for future development and organization of the idea.

## Available Documents

- **ACUTIS Main Proposal** – overview of the concept
- **ACUTIS Summary** – concise description of the project
- **Pitch Deck ACUTIS** – presentation slides for stakeholders
- **Invention Disclosure Form** – preliminary intellectual property filing
- **ProvisionalPatent ACUTIS** – provisional patent paperwork

All documentation is provided as PDF or RTF files in the repository root. Additional notes can be kept inside the `docs/` directory.

## Repository Structure

The following directories provide a starting framework:

- `docs/` – supplementary design notes and references
- `src/` – pseudocode modules outlining the planned system
- `tests/` – placeholder test suite

The current files offer pseudocode for hardware, collar control, data acquisition,
signal processing, and simple simulation utilities. A high level scanner module
demonstrates how these pieces could work together. These placeholders are
intentionally lightweight and will evolve as the project matures.
