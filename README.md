# ACUTIS

ACUTIS is an early stage concept represented only by project documents and descriptive notes. No working code has been written yet. The repository simply organizes ideas and provides a place to collect design discussions as the system evolves.

## Available Documents

- **ACUTIS Main Proposal** – overview of the concept
- **ACUTIS Summary** – concise description of the project
- **Pitch Deck ACUTIS** – presentation slides for stakeholders
- **Invention Disclosure Form** – preliminary intellectual property filing
- **ProvisionalPatent ACUTIS** – provisional patent paperwork

All documentation is provided as PDF or RTF files in the repository root. Additional notes can be kept inside the `docs/` directory.

## Repository Structure

The following directories provide a starting framework:

- `docs/` – supplementary design notes and references
- `docs/notes/` – short descriptions of proposed modules, including the main transducer and scanning workflow
- `tests/` – placeholder test suite

The notes outline ideas for hardware, collar movement, data acquisition, signal processing, and scanning. They exist purely as planning material and contain no executable code.
