# ACUTIS

ACUTIS is an early stage concept currently represented by a collection of project documents. This repository lays the groundwork for future development and organization of the idea.

## Available Documents

- **ACUTIS Main Proposal** – overview of the concept
- **ACUTIS Summary** – concise description of the project
- **Pitch Deck ACUTIS** – presentation slides for stakeholders
- **Invention Disclosure Form** – preliminary intellectual property filing
- **ProvisionalPatent ACUTIS** – provisional patent paperwork

All documentation is provided as PDF files in the repository root. Additional notes can be kept inside the `docs/` directory.

## Repository Structure

The following directories provide a starting framework:

- `docs/` – supplementary design notes and references
- `src/` – future source code
- `tests/` – test materials for any code that will be added later

This layout is intentionally minimal to keep the focus on concept exploration. Detailed implementation and scripts will come later as the project matures.
